# OnlineShoesDatabases
 This project was developed during my first semester in College, in databases module. 
 The propose of this project was to choose an online retail businnes and develope a databases for that.
 After drawn an ER diagram and a conceptual design in a 3rd form, the tables was created by using mySQL Workbench.
 The tables were populated using Moockaroo. And after that I write SQL statements to answer all questions.
 I also have created a graphical representation of some questions using the reporting tool Excel.
 There is also the dump file (self-contained SQL script) of the full database, including triggers and stored procedures.
