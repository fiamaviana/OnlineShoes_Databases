# OnlineShoesDatabases
   This project was developed during my first semester in college, in the database module.
   The purpose of this project was to choose an online retail business and develop a database for it.
   After drawing an ER diagram and a conceptual design on a third form, the tables were created using the mySQL Workbench.
   The tables were filled out using Moockaroo. And after that, I wrote SQL statements to answer all the questions.
   I have also created a graphical representation of some questions using the Excel reporting tool, but it is connected to my databases and requires my password to have access to    it, to solve this issue I saved the graphs in PDF format just for you to have a look if you want.
   There is also the dump file (self-contained SQL script) of the complete database, including triggers and stored procedures.
